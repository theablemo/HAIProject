Hi, I've been having this back pain for the past month, so I'd just like something for it an and you know image it if possible just to figure out what it is.
Yeah yes.
It's in my lower back. 
It's kind of dull and achy but sometimes I feel like I have little spasms in my back.
Um I'd say like two to three times a week.
It's pretty constant, but it gets worse with certain things.
So I work in this factory where I move a lot of boxes and I think I may have like lifted a really heavy box or lifted it in an improper position because that's when, that night is when my back started hurting.
For the past 30 years.
I'd say it's pretty. It's been pretty similar to the start.
No OK. Have you tried anything that has helped you?
I've tried some topical analgesics, and you know those fire and ice gels and I think sometimes that helps, but it's always temporary.
Yeah, bending down like it when I flex my back that hurts more than if I straighten it out.
Um a little bit more towards my right side.
No.
Um no
Nope.
No.
No.
No.
Um no.
No.
No.

I have a high blood pressure which I take some Ramipril for.
No.
No.
No. 
No.
No.
I'm taking some time off work until I figure out what this back pain is. 
I live in an apartment with my wife and our teenage son.
I used to smoke. I haven't smoked in over 10 years.
I drink occasionally, I'll have like a beer on the weekend.
No. 
OK.
OK.
Um it kinda hurts right in the middle, uh, just above the buttocks area an where like my tailbone almost is
I can try that. Um that hurts a little bit, yeah.
That hurts in my lower back.
Um no, I don't see anything like that.
I'm able to walk without a limp. 
Yes. 
No, just like how can I treat this?
Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.
