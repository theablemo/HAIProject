So one month ago when it started before then, did you injure yourself at all or, were you doing anything that brought on the pain or did the pain come on gradually?
OK, I see and how long have you worked in this role?
OK Alright. And has the pain become worse at all or has it stayed the same since it started?
OK. And does the back pain move anywhere, like for example does it shoot down your legs at all?
OK. Have you tried anything that has helped you?
OK. And what kind of things make your pain worse like, bending down as opposed to stretching backwards?
OK. Is a bending hurts more and what about bending towards the sides?

So when you press your hand down, down your spine. Is it hurt at all in the lower back with palpation?
I see. And, uh, any kind of pain with lying down and then raising your legs straight up without bending the knees.
And does it hurt in the lower back or near the front of your hips?
And any kind of redness or swelling that you've noticed at all? I know it's in the back, so it might be more difficult to see.
OK. And are you, has your gait, changed at all, or is it, are you able to walk without a limp or anything?
OK. Alright, so and then, uh, bending down you said hurts more than standing up or extending your back, right?

OK. Alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions for me? 

Yeah, for sure. So this has been going on for the last month. It sounds more like what's called mechanical back pain and due to the nature of your work having been lifting heavy objects for the last 30 or so years it's usually something that occurs with repetitive, repetitive work, and strenuous work like that that affects your back. And what you're describing with the flexion seems more pain coming from the discs themselves instead of the facets at the back. So every time you flex you have some compression of your discs. So what we what we need to do right now is it's been one month almost and then usually we get imaging if the pain does not improve after six weeks of conservative management. So what we can try is to give you some pain management first, and some anti-inflammatory medication, and then as well as try some physiotherapy, some exercises to help you with the back pain. And then if the pain does not improve and since there is no red flags that were too worried about right now with your back pain we can wait to get some imaging. But first we would just like to try some of the conservative management. Is that OK with you?

You're welcome, alright take care.
